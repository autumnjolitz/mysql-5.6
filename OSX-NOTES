If you get readline errors, you're going to need to remove the CMakeLists files and CMake generated files

Up-to-date readline:
# brew install readline
# brew link --force readline


Clang on OSX requires CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS to be set to ' -Wno-c++11-narrowing -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++"

CMake options:
-Dedit_INCLUDE_DIR=`brew --prefix readline`/include 
-Dedit_LIBRARY=`brew --prefix readline`/lib/libreadline.dylib
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-Wno-c++11-narrowing -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++'

My command line:

# cmake -Dedit_INCLUDE_DIR=`brew --prefix readline`/include  -Dedit_LIBRARY=`brew --prefix readline`/lib/libreadline.dylib -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-Wno-c++11-narrowing -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -I`brew --prefix readline`/include' .
# make

Be sure to:
rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles/ VERSION.dep include/probes_mysql.d if it gets stuck on old conf data
